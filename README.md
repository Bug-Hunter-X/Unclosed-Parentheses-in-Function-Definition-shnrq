# Unclosed Parentheses in Function Definition
This repository demonstrates a common Python error: forgetting to close parentheses in function definitions. This leads to a `SyntaxError`.

## Bug
The `bug.py` file contains a function definition with an unclosed parenthesis. This will cause a syntax error when the code is run.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version of the function definition, with the closing parenthesis added. 

This simple example highlights the importance of careful attention to detail when writing code in any language.
